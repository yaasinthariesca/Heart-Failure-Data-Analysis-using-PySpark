**Big Data**
is a set of processes consisting of large volumes of well-structured data
and unstructured which are used to assist business activities. Big data
generate large data and require a large volume of storage as well,
so big data requires qualified data processing applications.

**PySpark**
is an application for Apache Spark with the python programming language. Apaches
Spark is a framework or environment that can be used to access,
process, to store data from various different sources. Main features of Apache Spark
is in-memory cluster computing that increases data processing speed at scale
large scale, including Big Data and Machine Learning.

In this portfolio, I implemented PySpark for Heart Failure dataset analysis
(Heart Failure) obtained from Kaggle.
